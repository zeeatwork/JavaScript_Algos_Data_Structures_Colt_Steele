# Algorithm and Problem Solving Patterns

## OBJECTIVES

1. Define Algorithm
2. Devise a plan to solve algorithmic problems
3. Compare and contrast problem solving patterns (counters, two pointer problems, divide & conquer)

### Algorithm: A process or set of steps to accomplish a task.

- Almost everything in programming involves algorithms
- It's the foundation of success problem solving

### How do you improve problem solving skills?

1. Devise a plan for solving problem
2. Master common problem solving patterns

### Problem Solving Strategies/Steps

1. Understand the problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look back and refactor

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs for my function?
- What are the outputs for my function's solution?
- Can outputs be determined by inputs?
  - Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
- How should I label my data?

#### Step 2: Explore concrete examples

- Provides 'sanity checks'
- Helps you learn about the goal
- Aids and confirms your understanding
  _* The Steps *_
- Start Simple => move to complex
- Explore edge cases and invalid entries
  - Incorrect Data types/Invalid Entries/Empty Entries

#### Step 3: Break it down

- Explicity lay out your steps!
- Make shell functions and psuedocode or comment steps

#### Step 4: Solve or Simplify
  * Solve what you can
  * Solve a simpler problem
    * Focus on the part of the problem you know how to solve
    * Incorporate the part you figure out how to solve 
    * Maybe figure out how to do the thing in one value, then you can loop or use a high order function
  * Communicate with the reviewer  
#### Step 5: Look Back and Refactor
  * Can you check the result
  * Can the result be achieved differently
  * Is it readable?
  * Is the method reusable?
  * Can performance be improved
  * How have others solved it?
  * Create helper functions(readible, reusable, performant)?
